# My Portfolio Website

This is a personal portfolio website built to showcase my skills, projects, and professional background. The site is designed to be clean, modern, and fully responsive across all devices.

## Features

- **Interactive Desktop Interface:** The portfolio is presented as a virtual desktop with movable, resizable windows for different sections (e.g., About, Projects, Contact).

- **Dynamic Theming:** Users can toggle between light and dark modes, which smoothly changes the entire color palette of the site.

- **Sound Effects:** Subtle audio cues enhance the user experience as they interact with the virtual desktop.

- **Dynamic Waves:** The animated wave background creates a serene and engaging visual experience.

## Some Technologies Used

- **Google Fonts:** For custom typography, including the header font, Oswald, and the body font, Inter.

- **Zapsplat:** For sound effects and audio assets.

- **react-wavify:** A React component used to generate the dynamic, animated wave effects.

- **react-draggable:** A React component used to make the windows draggable.
